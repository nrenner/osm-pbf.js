osm-pbf-js
==========

Forked from visual trip planner, using only the PBF reading part, with the idea to have a 
general purpose JavaScript library for reading the OpenStreetMap PBF format.

Currently does not support Relations and metadata.

See Branch 'browser' for development on reading PBF in the Browser (evaluation / Proof of Concept).

**see also:** [ProtoBuf.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/ProtoBuf.js) + [osm-read](https://github.com/marook/osm-read) (might continue with that)
