pbf-js
======

Forked from visual trip planner, using only the PBF reading part, with the idea to have a 
general purpose JavaScript library for reading the OpenStreetMap PBF format.

Currently does not support Relations and metadata.

See Branch 'browser' for development on reading PBF in the Browser (evaluation / Proof of Concept).
